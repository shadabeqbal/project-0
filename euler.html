                <p><strong>Leonhard Euler</strong>&nbsp; (German:&nbsp;15 April 1707&nbsp;– 18 September 1783) was a
                    Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician&nbsp;and engineer who made
                    important and influential discoveries in many
                    branches of mathematics, such as infinitesimal calculus&nbsp;and graph theory, while also making
                    pioneering contributions to several branches such as topology&nbsp;and analytic<a

                    theory. He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly
                    for mathematical analysis, such as the notion of a mathematical function.&nbsp;He is also known for
                    his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics,

        <p>Euler was one of the most eminent mathematicians of the 18th century and is held to be one of the greatest in
            history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific, as his collected works fill 92
            volumes,&nbsp;more than anyone else in
            the field. He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersbugh, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of
            Prussia.<br></p>

    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 28px;">
        <p>Leonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707, in Basel, Switzerland, to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the Reformed
            Church,&nbsp;and Marguerite née Brucker, another pastor's daughter. He had two younger sisters, Anna Maria
            and Maria Magdalena, and a
            younger brother, Johann Heinrich.&nbsp;Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Eulers moved from Basel to the
            town of Riehen, Switzerland, where Leonhard spent most of his childhood. Paul was a friend of the
            Bernoulli<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_family">&nbsp;</a>family,Johann
            Nernoulli&nbsp;then regarded as Europe's foremost mathematician, would eventually be the most important
            influence on young Leonhard.<br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 28px;">
        <p>Euler's formal education started in Basel, where he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother. In 1720,
            at age thirteen, he enrolled at the&nbsp;<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Basel">University of B</a>Basel. In 1723,
            he received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of&nbsp;<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes">Descartes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Newton</a>.
            During that time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered
            his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics.<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#cite_note-childhood-10">[10]</a>&nbsp;At
            that time Euler's main studies included theology, Greek&nbsp;and Hebrew&nbsp;at his father's urging to
            become a pastor, but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great
            mathematician.<br></p>

        <p>In 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the&nbsp;<a

            that time, he was unsuccessfully attempting to obtain a position at the University of Basel. In 1727, he
            first entered the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences"><em>Paris

                        1739 he wrote the&nbsp;<em>Tentamen novae theoriae musicae,</em>&nbsp;hoping to eventually
                        incorporate&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theory">musical
                            theory</a>&nbsp;as

                        described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.<a
