Mathematicians
            are concerned with numbers, data, quantity, structure, space, models, and change.<br><br></p>
        <h1 class="display-4 text-center" id="heading2" style="margin-top: -60px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">History</span></h1>
        <p class="lead" style="padding: 60px;margin-top: -80px;"><br><br>One of the earliest known mathematicians was Thales of Miletus&nbsp;(c. 624–c.546 BC); he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed. He is credited
            with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales Theorem.<br><br></p>
        <p class="lead" style="padding: 60px;margin-top: -175px;"><br>The number of known mathematicians grew when Pythagoras of Samos&nbsp;(c. 582–c. 507 BC) established the Pythagorean School, whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was "All is number".It was the Pythagoreans
            who coined the term "mathematics", and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins.<br><br></p>
        <p class="lead" style="padding: 60px;margin-top: -200px;"><br><br>The first woman mathematician recorded by history was Hypatia&nbsp;of Alexandria (AD 350 - 415). She succeeded her father as Librarian at the Great Library and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because of a political dispute, the
            Christian community in Alexandria punished her, presuming she was involved, by stripping her naked and scraping off her skin with clamshells (some say roofing tiles).<br><br><br></p>
        <p class="lead" style="padding: 60px;margin-top: -257px;"><br><br><br>Science and mathematics in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models and modes of funding varied based primarily on scholars. It was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific
            rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas. Funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs,&nbsp;and it turned out that certain scholars became experts
            in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences. As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences. An
            example of a translator and mathematician who benefited from this type of support was al-Khawarizmi. A notable feature of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times is that they were often polymaths. Examples include the work
            on optics, maths&nbsp;and astronomy&nbsp;of Ibn al-Haytham.<br><br><br><br></p>

        <ul style="margin-left: 41px;margin-top: 38px;">
            <li><strong>Applied mathematics :&nbsp;</strong><em>Mathematicians involved with solving problems with applications in real life are called </em><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">applied mathematics.</span></em></strong><br></li>
            <li><strong>Abstract mathematics : </strong>Pure mathematics<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is&nbsp;mathematics&nbsp;that studies entirely abstract concepts.<br></li>
            <li><strong>Mathematics teaching :&nbsp;</strong><em>Many professional mathematicians also engage in the teaching of mathematics. Duties may include:</em><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>teaching university mathematics courses.<br></li>
                    <li>supervising undergraduate and graduate research.<br></li>
                    <li>serving on academic committees.<br></li>

            <li style="width: 1074px;"><strong>Consulting :&nbsp;</strong><em>Many careers in mathematics outside of universities involve consulting. For instance, actuaries assemble and analyze data to estimate the probability and likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property.</em><br></li>
