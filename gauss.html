                <p><strong>Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss</strong>&nbsp;(Latin:&nbsp;<em>Carolus Fridericus Gauss</em>; 30 April 1777&nbsp;– 23 February 1855) was a German mathematician&nbsp;and physicist who made significant contributions to many fields in
                    mathematics and science.&nbsp;Sometimes referred to as the&nbsp;<em>Princeps mathematicorum</em>&nbsp;(Latin&nbsp;for '"the foremost of mathematicians"') and "the greatest mathematician since antiquity", Gauss had an exceptional influence
                    in many fields of mathematics and science, and is ranked among history's most influential mathematicians.<br></p>

    <h1 class="display-4 text-center" style="margin-top: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Early Life</span></h1>
    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 28px;">
        <p>Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in Brunswick<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braunschweig">&nbsp;</a>(Braunschweh), in the&nbsp;Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel&nbsp;(now part of&nbsp;Lower Saxony, Germany), to poor,
            working-class parents.&nbsp;His mother was illiterate and never recorded the date of his birth, remembering only that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the&nbsp;Feast of the Ascension&nbsp;(which occurs 39 days after Easter).
            Gauss later solved this puzzle about his birthdate in the context of&nbsp;finding the date of Easter, deriving methods to compute the date in both past and future years.&nbsp;He was christened and confirmed in a church near the school he attended
            as a child.<br></p>

    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 28px;">
        <p>Gauss was a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy">child prodigy</a>. In his memorial on Gauss,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Sartorius_von_Waltershausen">Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen</a>&nbsp;says
            that when Gauss was barely three years old he corrected a math error his father made; and that when he was seven, he confidently solved an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression">arithmetic series</a>&nbsp;problem
            faster than anyone else in his class of 100 students.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#cite_note-9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Many versions of this story have been retold since that time with various details regarding what the
            series was – the most frequent being the classical problem of adding all the integers from 1 to 100.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#cite_note-:0-10"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[10]</span></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#cite_note-11">[11]</a>

                breakthrough occurred in 1796 when he showed that a regular&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon">polygon</a>&nbsp;can be constructed by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_and_straightedge_constructions">compass and straightedge</a>&nbsp;if

                was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece">Ancient Greeks</a>, and the discovery ultimately
                led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology">philology</a>&nbsp;as a career. Gauss was so pleased with this result that he requested that a regular&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptadecagon">heptadecagon</a>&nbsp;be
                inscribed on his tombstone. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_masonry">stonemason</a>&nbsp;declined, stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like a circle.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#cite_note-17">[16]</a><br></p>

            <li><strong>Algebra</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>In his 1799 doctorate in absentia,&nbsp;<em>A new proof of the theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of the first or second degree</em>, Gauss proved the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra">fundamental theorem of algebra</a>&nbsp;which
                        states that every non-constant single-variable&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial">polynomial</a>&nbsp;with complex coefficients has at least one complex&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_function">root</a>.
                        Mathematicians including&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_le_Rond_d%27Alembert"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jean le Rond d'Alembert</span></a>&nbsp;had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's
                        dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to the implicit use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem">Jordan curve theorem</a>.
                        However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.<br></li>
                    <li>Gauss also made important contributions to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory">number theory</a>&nbsp;with his 1801 book&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disquisitiones_Arithmeticae"><em>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</em></a>&nbsp;(

                            It appears that Gauss already knew the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_number_formula">class number formula</a>&nbsp;in 1801.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#cite_note-54">[51]</a><br></li>

                    <li>On 1 January 1801, Italian astronomer&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Piazzi">Giuseppe Piazzi</a>&nbsp;discovered the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet">dwarf planet</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)">Ceres</a>.
                        Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat more than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared,
                        Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit. Gauss heard about the problem and
                        tackled it. After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801—just about a year after its first sighting—and this turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when it was rediscovered by&nbsp;

                        intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths
                        of the arcs can be calculated by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kepler's Second Law</span></a>). This problem leads to an equation of the
                        eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work, Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he
                        created for that purpose.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#cite_note-55">[52]</a><br></li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Gauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry">non-Euclidean geometries</a>&nbsp;but never published it. This discovery was a major&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift">paradigm shift</a>&nbsp;in
                        mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory.<br></li>
                    <li>Research on these geometries led to, among other things,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Einstein</a>'s theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean. His friend&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkas_Bolyai">Farkas Wolfgang Bolyai</a>&nbsp;with
                        whom Gauss had sworn "brotherhood and the banner of truth" as a student, had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry.<br></li>
                    <li>Bolyai's son,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai">János Bolyai</a>, discovered non-Euclidean geometry in 1829; his work was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: "To praise it
                        would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work&nbsp;... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years." This unproved statement put a
                        strain on his relationship with Bolyai who thought that Gauss was "stealing" his idea.<br></li>

                            a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which was in use well into the second half of the 20th century, and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere">magnetospheric</a>)
